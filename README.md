## General Information

Repository to host the solar academy course on PV fault detection: "Operational research for urban solar development".

The course is derived from the workshop given at [Datasun 2022](https://github.com/AlexandreHugoMathieu/pvfault_detection/blob/main/notebooks/PV%20Fault%20detection.ipynb).

### Ressources

The repository relies on some functions from pvlib and pvanalytics.

- pvlib: https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- pvanalytics: https://pvanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

The master has also been inspired from the [PVlib tutorial](https://pvsc-python-tutorials.github.io/PVSC48-Python-Tutorial/Tutorial%200%20-%20Overview.html).

I sincerely thank those developers who offer the possibilities to other researchers to build from the top-edge methods.


## Setup

### Install Python 3.9

[python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

### Virtual Environment
